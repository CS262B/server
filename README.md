Repo for our server documentation and web service

This is server documentation for the back end of the Android application "Pathfinders," which is a map app to find destinations on Calvin College's campus. 

**NOTE: Do not try pulling the PathfinderWebService using the VCS function in IntelliJ IDEA, you must create a new project and copy/paste         the code. This is because of the extra files in the server repo, which mess with IntelliJ's system.
